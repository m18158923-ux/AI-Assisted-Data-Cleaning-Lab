# AI-Assisted Data Cleaning: Titanic Dataset
This project demonstrates the 80% of data science work that happens before modeling: Cleaning.

## Steps Completed:
1. **Discovery:** Identified missing values in 'Age', 'Fare', and 'Cabin'.
2. **Imputation:** Filled numerical gaps with medians and categorical gaps with 'Unknown'.
3. **Encoding:** Used One-Hot Encoding to turn gender/port categories into numbers.
4. **Standardization:** Scaled numerical data to ensure mathematical balance.

*Developed as an 'Architect' using AI as a Senior Data Scientist partner.*
